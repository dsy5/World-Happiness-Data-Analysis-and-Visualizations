  The World Happiness Report is a publication of data collected by the Gallup World Poll. Data collected consists of a variety of six different statistics, from GDP per capita to freedom to corruption. 
  
  Check out this website to learn more about the World Happiness Report: https://worldhappiness.report/
  
  In my first data science project, I wanted to visualize the massive amounts of data collected from the World Happiness Reports over the years in order to present the data in a user-friendly and understandable format. I used the programming language *R* to achieve my goals. 
  
  First, I found two datasets (CSVs) on Kaggle that contained data from the World Happiness Report 2021 as well as data from the World Happiness Report over past years. From that point, I began analyzing, cleaning, and forming creative and eye-catching graphics to illustrate facinating trends in the data.

  *I created this project as part of my final project for a free data science bootcamp (https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/) I enrolled in during the Summer of 2021. The course covered the first three weeks in Harvard Preceptor David Kane's Gov 1005: Data class. In this bootcamp, I was first exposed to basic data science by learning R and GitHub.*
