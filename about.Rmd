  The World Happiness Report is a publication of data collected by the Gallup World Poll. Data collected consists of a variety of six different statistics, from GDP per capita to freedom to corruption. 
  
    One statistic that the report collects is a life ladder score. The life ladder score is based on the Cantril Ladder Score (on a scale of 10). A higher life ladder score indicates a better life while a lower score indicates a worse life.

  In my first data science project, I wanted to visualize the massive amounts of data collected from the World Happiness Reports over the years in order to present the data in a user-friendly and understandable format. I used the programming language *R* to achieve my goals. 
  
  First, I found two datasets (CSVs) on Kaggle that contained data from the World Happiness Report 2021 as well as data from the World Happiness Report over past years. From that point, I began analyzing, cleaning, and forming creative and eye-catching graphics to illustrate facinating trends in the data.
